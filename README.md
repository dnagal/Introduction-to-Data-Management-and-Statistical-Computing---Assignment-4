# Introduction-to-Data-Management-and-Statistical-Computing---Assignment-4
This assignment entails reading and merging files, comparing file attributes, data quality control, and using the ODS function to generate tables and reports on SAS. 

The first half of the assignment uses the XPT zip file. Tasks include assigning the exported files into a new library and merging specific files. Quality checks are made by using if, then, and where statements. Lastly, the ODS function is used to create an rtf file that transfers the table into a word document better suited for written reports like scholarly articles. 

the second half of the assignment uses the best_countries dataset where we organize variables using proc format. Tables are created using different variables, in addition to statistical testing such as chi-squared and fisher's exact test.
